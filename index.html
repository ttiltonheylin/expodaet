                <h2>About,</h2>
                <h4>how this came to pass..</h4>
                <p>I was sick and tired of pouring through books and references, (for the same subject over and over again), only to do the same exact thing for the next location I was working at under a new set of circumstances. I also wanted something I could call my own, while being able to stylize it the way I saw fit. As I began to learn front-end web development, it became more and more clear that building a website was going to be the ultimate expression for <strike>my</strike> <mark>a bar manual</mark>.
                    <br>This collection of knowledge you see before you has been primarily collected by others, from a long list of sources. I will try my darnedest to keep track of all the sources I reference throughout my research here. I hope this manual can be a tool for you and your cohorts, throughout your's and their experience, both as a guest, and staff, illuminating the way through the beverage experience. It is to be noted that this is a work in progress, don't get judgy. lol. If you have feed back just let me know. I you see something that is blatantly wrong and a misstatement of a fact. Express yourself. This manual is meant to be right but sometimes it won't be. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="how-to" class="section-wrap two">
                <h2>How to,</h2>
                <h4>and a why for..</h4>
                <p>This manual is set up to be a reference to a question. How should we go about tasting this wine? What properties or attributes do we want to identify?  <mark>What is the best way to make cinnamon syrup and why?</mark>  How is tequila made and where? What is the best produce to use in the northeast during spring?<br>If you find yourself asking these questions I will hopefully have some answers for you in here somewhere. The information has been arranged to answer your hypotheticals. </p>
				<p><mark>Visually boring and intellectually pleasing</mark> is something I have encountered many times, as I'm sure you've too. I don't think that is as neccesary as it once was. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tasting" class="section-wrap">
                <h2>Tasting</h2>
                <h4>from humble beginnings</h4>
                <p>Tasting for me has always been the fun part. To take witness of a craft(s) person(s)'s hard work is a beautiful thing when the craft has been executed beautifully. Also being able to understand all the nuances imprinted on the craft is a beautiful process. Tasting a final product is usually the last place in the crafting process but it is the easiest place to start in the understanding process. <br><mark>It is where guest and artist meet.</mark> <br>Also if you have a mouth, a tongue, and a nose you can start your beverage journey. Those are really the only prerequisites you need. Anyone can taste. So with that, I hope to leave all pretention at the door as you walk into the hall that is the wide world of beverages. </p>

                <h2>Cocktail Portfolio
					<a id="cocktail-portfolio-link" class="export-link" href="cocktail-portfolio.html">--></a></h2>
                <h4>potions, fixes and other cure alls</h4>
                <p>Arguably the largest array of information I am personally commiting to this index. This section houses the process of making ingredients for cocktails. Which tools to use to make the ingredients. How to put the ingredients together most efficiently. And How they got together in the first place. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="wine" class="section-wrap">
                <h2>Wine</h2>
                <h4>yum</h4>
                <p>A catalog of all the stuff out there that I have or you could come in contact with. How that stuff is made. Who makes it. And why it gets made that way. Wine is cool and old. </p>
            </div>
        <div id="spirits" class="section-wrap">
            <h2>Spirits</h2>
            <h4>ahhhh</h4>
            <p>A relatively new establishment compared to beer and wine but a short history is made up for with a potent history. The story of the spirit reaches all around the globe. Sailor's beware the cry of the <strike> spirit</strike> siren.</p>

        <div id="beer" class="section-wrap">
            <h2>Beer</h2>
            <h4>mmmm</h4>
            <p>A favorite of monks, and dudes that live in the woods with beards like monks. Beer is always the fun guy at the party. Beer can get serious too. </p>
